# Welcome to GitHub

l have seen this language before.

I am learning the basics like variables, conditionals, arithmetic, basic syntax, and string manipulation.

I can read other peoples code. I can find and fix simple bugs.

I can break down problems and I am prepared to reuse existing code, while implementing new functions/classes of my own and specialized libraries. I can trace the execution of most programs with ease.

I can write lean, well structured code to solve complex problems utilizing the full extent of the language's feature set.
